#NyayAI - Enterprise GCP Legal AI Assistant
This enterprise system provides judicial clerks and legal professionals with a secure environment to upload, parse, analyze, and search vast volumes of legal records.
By leveraging specialized Legal AI models and isolated cloud security, the platform transforms manual, multi-day document reviews into near-instantaneous semantic searches and insights, while guaranteeing absolute data privacy and compliance.

🛡️ Layer-by-Layer Component Directory
1. Frontend & Ingestion Layer
This is the entry gate where users securely interact with the application.
• 🌐 Google Cloud Run / Firebase (Web Portal):
	• Function: Powers the user-facing web interface. It gives judicial clerks a fast, clean workspace to upload case files, view generated summaries, and run search queries.
• 🛡️ Google Cloud Armor:
	• Function: Acts as the platform's shield against malicious online traffic. It blocks cyber attacks, filters out suspicious traffic (WAF), stops automated bot floods (DDoS protection), and prevents the system from being overwhelmed by too many requests at once (Rate Limiting).
• 🔒 HTTPS / TLS 1.3 Encryption:
	• Function: Secures the "data in transit." Every file uploaded or click made by a user is encrypted using modern protocols, making it impossible for third parties to intercept or eavesdrop on sensitive information.
2. Processing & Document AI Layer
This layer handles the heavy lifting of turning raw images and scanned papers into digital text.
• 📄 GCP Document AI (Specialized Legal OCR):
	• Function: A specialized optical character recognition engine trained specifically on legal terminology and layouts. It reads PDFs, scanned briefs, and even messy handwritten notes, accurately turning them into clean, machine-readable digital text.
• ⏳ Cloud Tasks:
	• Function: Manages the workload queue behind the scenes. When a clerk uploads a massive document stack (1,000+ pages), Cloud Tasks breaks the job down into smaller, asynchronous batches. This keeps the application running smoothly without freezing or crashing the system.
3. Gen AI Engine & RAG Pipeline
The system's core brain, responsible for deep analysis and intelligent legal reasoning.
• 🤖 Vertex AI Gemini 1.5 Pro:
	• Function: A cutting-edge generative AI foundation model featuring a massive 2-million token context window. This allows the AI to "read" and reason across an entire library of case files, active trial binders, and thousands of pages of evidence simultaneously to answer complex legal questions accurately.
• 📐 Vertex AI Embeddings API:
	• Function: Converts standard text and legal arguments into complex mathematical concepts called "embeddings." This allows the system to understand the true semantic meaning and context of legal terms, rather than just matching exact keywords.
• 🔍 Vertex AI Vector Search:
	• Function: The core engine driving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). When a user searches for relevant case law, this component instantly scours the entire system to retrieve historically similar legal precedents and contextually relevant case studies.
4. Secure Storage & Persistence Layer
The secure vault where all legal data, assets, and metadata reside permanently.
• 🪣 Cloud Storage (Case Files Bucket):
	• Function: Provides a highly resilient, isolated storage repository for raw uploads, massive PDFs, legal briefs, and digital evidence dossiers.
• 🗄️ Cloud Spanner / Firestore:
	• Function: The structured databases of the platform. They organize and store crucial system metadata, including indexing information, case reference numbers, upload timestamps, user permissions, and document properties.
5. Security & Governance Layer
A cross-cutting safety net that monitors and restricts actions across the entire platform.
• 🔑 Cloud KMS (Customer-Managed Encryption Keys):
	• Function: Provides total data sovereignty. Instead of relying on generic cloud vendor security, the organization uses its own cryptographic keys to encrypt data at rest, ensuring that no outside entity (including cloud engineers) can unlock the files.
• 🆔 Cloud IAM (Identity & Access Management):
	• Function: Enforces the "Principle of Least Privilege." It ensures that a user or a background service can only see and touch the exact files required to perform their specific job, strictly locking out unauthorized internal or external users.
• 📋 Cloud Logging & Audit Logs:
	• Function: Maintains a tamper-proof, immutable ledger of every single action taken in the system. It logs who looked at a file, when an AI model was triggered, and where data was moved, guaranteeing a perfect paper trail for strict legal compliance audits.
🧱 The Secure Boundary: VPC Service Controls
A critical architectural feature is the VPC Service Controls Perimeter. Think of this as a virtual fortress wall wrapping around the Processing, Gen AI, and Storage layers.
• Why it matters: Even if a malicious actor compromised an account inside the organization, the perimeter prevents them from copying, downloading, or exfiltrating sensitive legal files outside the cloud boundary.
• Private Service Connect: All traffic passing from the public web portal into this secure fortress travels over a private internal Google network, completely bypassing the open internet.

🏛️ Compliance & Regulatory Standards Framework
Because this platform handles sensitive legal evidence, judicial files, and personally identifiable information (PII), it adheres to strict security frameworks to guarantee data privacy, chain of custody, and systemic integrity.
• FedRAMP High / StateRAMP: The entire infrastructure utilizes Google Cloud services validated at the highest baseline for government use, ensuring maximum protection for state and federal judicial data.
• SOC 2 Type II: Certified for operational excellence across the five Trust Services Criteria: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy.
• HIPAA & CJIS Compliance:
	• CJIS (Criminal Justice Information Services): Strict alignment with FBI standards ensures proper fingerprinting, background checks for system operators, and hardened data boundaries for law enforcement and court records.
	• HIPAA: Built-in safeguards protect medical records or health information frequently introduced as evidence in civil and criminal litigation.
• Data Sovereignty & Zero Data Leakage: Through Cloud KMS (CMEK) and Vertex AI Privacy Controls, uploaded legal files are exclusively accessible to authorized personnel. The data is never used to train public foundation models.
